  <h1>Gramigna with sausage and cream</h1>

  <p>Click <a href="../posts.html">here</a> to go back.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <p>Gramigna is a fish-hooked pasta shape local to Bologna and the surrounding Emilia-Romagna region and is often
    served bi-coloured, a mix of plain and green pasta &mdash; coloured with spinach when being made &mdash; and seems
    relatively unknown in the UK, at least. Traditionally, gramigna is only served with a few mainly sausage-based
    sauces, including this simple recipe. Note the sausage meat needs to be Italian-style sausage meat with
    a high pork content and seasoned with fennel seeds and similar.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>One small white onion,</li>
    <li>200 grams Italian sausage meat,</li>
    <li>Knob of butter,</li>
    <li>200 millilitres single cream,</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste,</li>
    <li>200 grams gramigna.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method</h2>

  <p>Tear the sausage meat into small centimetre-sized lumps and set aside &mdash; do not smooth into balls like
    meatballs, but ensure they retain torn edges, which will "catch" and brown irregularly when cooking. Dice and gently
    fry the onion in the butter until soft. Add the sausage meat to the pan, frying and turning gently until cooked
    through and browned all over. Add the cream to the pan, gently warming throughout, and adjust seasoning. Boil the
    gramigna in salted water until just short of <emph>al dente</emph>, taking a spoon of starchy pasta water from the
    pan and adding it to the cream sauce as it cooks. Drain the gramigna and stir into the sauce, heating through, and
    serve.
