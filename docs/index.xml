      <description>I am currently a Staff Research Engineer within the Security Group at Arm Research, UK. My current research focuses within Arm are privacy-preserving computation and correctness for low-level, security-critical software.
Prior to joining Arm, I was a postdoctoral research scientist, first at the Dipartimento di Scienze dell&amp;rsquo;Informazione at the University of Bologna, and later at the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. I worked on the specification and verification of low-level systems software, such as C compilers and ELF linkers.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving collaborative compute with Veracruz</title>

      <description>Veracruz is a project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for a while internally within Arm Research. Recently, Veracruz was released as an open-source project on Github, with all development and design discussions moving into the open. This was a precursor to the project being adopted by the Linux Foundation&amp;rsquo;s Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC), which I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to say finally happened a few weeks ago, at the beginning of April.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain a little bit more about the project and what its motivation.</description>
