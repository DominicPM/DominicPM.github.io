      <title>Privacy-preserving collaborative compute with Veracruz</title>

      <description>Veracruz is a project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for a while internally within Arm Research. Recently, Veracruz was released as an open-source project on Github, with all development and design discussions moving into the open. This was a precursor to the project being adopted by the Linux Foundation&amp;rsquo;s Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC), which I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to say finally happened a few weeks ago, at the beginning of April.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain a little bit more about the project and what its motivation.</description>

      <description>I am a Principal Applied Scientist within the Automated Reasoning Group at Amazon Web Services, Cambridge, UK (AWS, henceforth). Prior to moving to AWS I was:
A (Senior, then Staff, before finally being promoted to) Principal Research Engineer within the Systems Group at Arm Research, Cambridge, UK from 2017–2022. My research there focussed on privacy-preserving computation, as evidenced by the Confidential Computing Consortium-adopted Veracruz project, a project which I initiated and thereafter acted as technical lead on.</description>
