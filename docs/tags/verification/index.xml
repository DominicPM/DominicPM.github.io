      <description>Nearly all working mathematicians make extensive use of non-constructive, classical reasoning principles including the Law of the Excluded Middle and the Axiom of Choice in their day-to-day work. Interestingly, despite mostly working classically, mathematicians are able to &amp;ldquo;drop down&amp;rdquo; into restricted modes of reasoning — a purely-constructive mode, or a mode where Excluded Middle is permissible but the Axiom of Choice is not, for example — where and when the need arises.</description>

      <description>Nick Spinale and I recently submitted a short talk abstract to the Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC) workshop, co-located with POPL 2022. The abstract, which was thankfully accepted for presentation, describes some ideas that Nick and I have been discussing for a while. I&amp;rsquo;ll use this post to flesh the abstract out and explain the design of the prototype Supervisionary proof-checking system which Nick and I have been working on.</description>
