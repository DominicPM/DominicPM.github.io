      <description>Nick Spinale and I recently submitted a short talk abstract to the Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC) workshop, co-located with POPL 2022. The abstract, which was thankfully accepted for presentation, describes some ideas that Nick and I have been discussing for a while. I&amp;rsquo;ll use this post to flesh the abstract out and explain the design of the prototype Supervisionary proof-checking system which Nick and I have been working on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to announce that &amp;ldquo;The Supervisionary proof-checking kernel, or: a work-in-progress towards proof-generating code&amp;rdquo;, which I co-authored with Nick Spinale, has been accepted for presentation at the workshop on Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC 2022), co-located with POPL.</description>
