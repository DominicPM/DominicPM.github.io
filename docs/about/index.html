    <p>I am a <strong>Principal Applied Scientist</strong> within the <em>Automated Reasoning Group</em> at <em>Amazon Web Services</em>, Cambridge, UK (AWS, henceforth).
Prior to moving to AWS I was:</p>
<img src = "images/portrait.jpg" alt="My portrait" style="border: 1px solid #000; max-width:120px; float:right; margin: 50px">
<ul>
<li>A (<strong>Senior</strong>, then <strong>Staff</strong>, before finally being promoted to) <strong>Principal Research Engineer</strong> within the <em>Systems Group</em> at <a href="https://www.arm.com/resources/research"><em>Arm Research</em></a>, Cambridge, UK from 2017–2022.
My research there focussed on privacy-preserving computation, as evidenced by the Confidential Computing Consortium-adopted <a href="https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz"><em>Veracruz</em> project</a>, a project which I initiated and thereafter acted as technical lead on.
Moreover, I also had a hand in developing software verification flows which provided strong evidence for the correctness for low-level, security-critical firmware, central to the <em>Arm Confidential Computing Architecture</em> (&ldquo;Arm CCA&rdquo;).
This is a Confidential Computing technology that will be deployed as a point-release for the Armv9-A architecture, and will eventually be found in hundreds of millions of devices worldwide.</li>
<li>A <strong>Postdoctoral Research Scientist</strong> (a &ldquo;postdoc&rdquo;), from 2012–2017, at the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk"><em>Computer Laboratory</em> at the <em>University of Cambridge</em></a>.
Here, I worked on <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/">Prof. Peter Sewell&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/"><em>Rigorous Engineering for Mainstream Systems</em> (&ldquo;REMS&rdquo;) project</a>.
I helped develop the Lem specification language, and developed a formal semantics of ELF static linking.
I also developed a side interest in the correctness of a class of distributed datastructure, called <em>Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes</em> (&ldquo;CRDTs&rdquo;).</li>
<li>A <strong>Postdoctoral Research Scientist</strong> (a &ldquo;postdoc&rdquo;), from 2010–2012, at the <a href="https://disi.unibo.it"><em>Dipartimento di Scienze dell&rsquo;Informazione</em> at the <em>Alma Mater Studiorum, Università di Bologna</em></a>.
I worked with <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/claudio.sacerdoticoen/en">Dr. Claudio Sacerdoti Coen</a> on the EU-funded <a href="http://cerco.cs.unibo.it"><em>Certified Complexity</em> (&ldquo;CerCo&rdquo;) project</a>, which aimed to produce a certified compiler, for a large fragment of C, capable of automatically lifting precise and reliable concrete complexity bounds from machine code to the original input source code.
I worked on the implementation and verification of the CerCo C compiler backend, using the (now sadly defunct) <a href="http://matita.cs.unibo.it">Matita proof assistant</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a PhD in theoretical computer science from the <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences.htm"><em>Department of Mathematics and Computer Science</em> at <em>Heriot-Watt University</em></a>, Edinburgh.
I studied various topics at the intersection of nominal techniques, unification, and type-theory and lambda-calculi.
My supervisors were <a href="http://www.gabbay.org.uk">Murdoch &ldquo;Jamie&rdquo; Gabbay</a> and <a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~trinder/">Phil Trinder</a>.</p>
