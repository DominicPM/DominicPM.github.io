      <title>Privacy-preserving collaborative compute with Veracruz</title>

      <description>Veracruz is a project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for a while internally within Arm Research. Recently, Veracruz was released as an open-source project on Github, with all development and design discussions moving into the open. This was a precursor to the project being adopted by the Linux Foundation&amp;rsquo;s Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC), which I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to say finally happened a few weeks ago, at the beginning of April.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain a little bit more about the project and what its motivation.</description>

      <description>Testing the configuration of MathJax and syntax highlighting $\lambda{x}.\ x$.
Types Terms I will fix a countably infinite set of variables, and will use $x, y, z$, and so on, to range permutatively over variables. Similarly, I will fix a countably infinite set of constants, and will use $C, D, E$, and so on, to range over constants.
Recursively define terms with the following grammar:
$$ % r, s, t ::= x \mid C \mid rs \mid \lambda{x{:}\tau}.</description>
