  <h2>Employment history</h2>

  <div class="employment">
    <span class="employer">Automated Reasoning Group, Amazon Web Services</span>
    <span class="employment-period">2022&ndash;present</span>
    <p>I am a <emph>Principal Applied Scientist</emph> within the <emph>Automated Reasoning Group</emph> at <emph>Amazon
        Web Services</emph>, Cambridge. I work on the verification of correctness and security properties of ultra
      low-level code.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="employment">
    <span class="employer">Systems Research Group, Arm Research</span>
    <span class="employment-period">2017&ndash;2022</span>
    <p>I was (eventually promoted to become a) <emph>Principal Research Engineer</emph> within the <emph>Systems Group
      </emph> at <emph>Arm Research</emph>, Cambridge.
      My research at Arm focussed on privacy-preserving computation, as evidenced
      by the <a href="https://confidentialcomputing.io">Confidential Computing Consortium</a>-adopted <a
        href="https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz">Veracruz</a> project, a project which I initiated and
      thereafter acted as technical lead on.
    </p>

    <p>I also helped develop software verification flows which provided strong evidence for the
      correctness for low-level, security-critical firmware, central to the <a
        href="https://www.arm.com/architecture/security-features/arm-confidential-compute-architecture">Arm
        Confidential Computing Architecture</a>, or Arm CCA. This is a Confidential Computing technology that will be
      deployed as a point-release for the Armv9-A architecture and will eventually be found in hundreds of millions
      of devices worldwide.</p>

  <div class="employment">
    <span class="employer">Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge</span>
    <span class="employment-period">2012&ndash;2017</span>
    <p>I was a <emph>Postdoctoral Research Scientist</emph> at the <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">Computer
        Laboratory</a> at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk">University of
        Cambridge</a>. Here, I worked on <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/">Prof. Peter Sewell’s</a> <a
        href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/people-new/index.html">Rigorous Engineering for Mainstream Systems</a>
      project, or <emph>REMS</emph>.
    </p>

    <p>At Cambridge I helped design and develop the <a href="https://github.com/rems-project/lem">Lem</a>
      specification language, and thereafter used Lem to formally specify the semantics of ELF static linking. I also
      developed a side interest in the correctness of a class of distributed datastructure, called <emph>Conflict-free
        Replicated Datatypes</emph>, or CRDTs.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="employment">
    <span class="employer">Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Informazione, University of Bologna, Italy</span>
    <span class="employment-period">2010&ndash;2012</span>

    <p>I was a <emph>Postdoctoral Research Scientist</emph> at the <a href="https://disi.unibo.it/it">Dipartimento di
        Scienze dell’Informazione</a> at the <a href="https://www.unibo.it/it/">Alma Mater Studiorum, Università di
        Bologna</a>. I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.unibo.it/~sacerdot/">Dr. Claudio Sacerdoti Coen</a> on
      the EU-funded <a
        href="https://www.unibo.it/en/research/projects-and-initiatives/Unibo-Projects-under-7th-Framework-Programme/cooperation-1/information-and-communication-technology-ict-1/cerco">Certified
        Complexity</a> project, or CerCo.</p>

    <p>CerCo aimed to produce a certified compiler, for a large fragment of C, capable of
      automatically lifting precise and reliable concrete complexity bounds from machine code to the original input
      source code. I worked on the implementation and verification of the CerCo C compiler backend, using the now
      sadly defunct <a href="http://matita.cs.unibo.it">Matita</a> proof assistant.

  <h2>Education</h2>

  <div class="employment">
    <span class="employer">Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh</span>
    <span class="employment-period">2007&ndash;2010</span>
    <p>I obtained my PhD in <emph>theoretical computer science</emph> from the <a
        href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences.htm">Department of Mathematics and Computer
        Science</a> at <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk">Heriot-Watt University</a>, Edinburgh. I studied various topics at
      the intersection of nominal techniques, unification, and type-theory and lambda-calculi. My supervisors were <a
        href="https://gabbay.org.uk">Dr. Murdoch “Jamie” Gabbay</a>
      and <a href="https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~trinder/">Prof. Phil Trinder</a>.</p>

    <p>Whilst a PhD student I used to play rugby union &mdash; starting in the backs, before ending up playing as a
      loosehead prop in the front row &mdash; for <a href="https://www.pitchero.com/clubs/lismore/">Lismore
        RUFC</a>. In summer, I also played cricket for <a
