I am currently a Staff Research Engineer within the Security Group at Arm Research, UK.
My current research focuses within Arm are *privacy-preserving computation* and *correctness* for low-level, security-critical software.

Prior to joining Arm, I was a postdoctoral research scientist, first at the Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Informazione at the University of Bologna, and later at the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge.
I worked on the specification and verification of low-level systems software, such as C compilers and ELF linkers.
At Cambridge, I also developed a side-interest in the correctness of distributed systems.

I have a PhD in theoretical computer science from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.
I studied various topics at the intersection of nominal techniques, unification, and type-theory and lambda-calculi.
My supervisor was Murdoch "Jamie" Gabbay.
