I am currently a *Principal Research Engineer* within the Systems Group at [Arm Research, UK](https://www.arm.com/resources/research).
My current research focuses within Arm are *privacy-preserving computation* and *correctness* for low-level, security-critical software.

Prior to joining Arm, I was a postdoctoral research scientist, first at the [Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Informazione at the University of Bologna](https://disi.unibo.it), and later at the [Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk).
I worked on the specification and verification of low-level systems software, such as C compilers and ELF linkers.
At Cambridge, I also developed a side-interest in the correctness of distributed systems.

I have a PhD in theoretical computer science from the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences.htm), Edinburgh.
I studied various topics at the intersection of nominal techniques, unification, and type-theory and lambda-calculi.
My supervisor was Murdoch "Jamie" Gabbay.
