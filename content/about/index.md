In mid-July I will be joining the Automated Reasoning Group within Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a Principal Applied Scientist.
Prior to moving to AWS I was:

- A Principal Research Engineer within the Systems Group at [Arm Research, UK](https://www.arm.com/resources/research) from 2017&ndash;2022.
My research there focussed on privacy-preserving computation, as evidenced by the Confidential Computing Consortium-adopted [*Veracruz* project](https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz), a project which I initiated and thereafter acted as technical lead on.
Moreover, I also had a hand in developing software verification flows which provided strong evidence for the correctness for low-level, security-critical firmware, central to the *Arm Confidential Computing Architecture* ("Arm CCA").
This is a technology that will be deployed in a point-release for the Armv9-A architecture, and eventually be found in hundreds of millions of devices, worldwide.
- A postdoctoral research scientist, from 2012&ndash;2017, at the [Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk).
Here, I worked on [Prof. Peter Sewell's](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/) [*Rigorous Engineering for Mainstream Systems* ("REMS") project](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/).
I helped develop the Lem specification language, and developed a formal semantics of ELF static linking.
I also developed a side interest in the correctness of a class of distributed datastructure, called *Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes* ("CRDTs").
- A postdoctoral research scientist, from 2010&ndash;2012, at the [Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Informazione at the University of Bologna](https://disi.unibo.it).
I worked with [Dr. Claudio Sacerdoti Coen](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/claudio.sacerdoticoen/en) on the EU-funded [*Certified Complexity* ("CerCo") project](http://cerco.cs.unibo.it), which aimed to produce a certified compiler, for a large fragment of C, capable of automatically lifting precise and reliable concrete complexity bounds from machine code to the original input source code.
I worked on the implementation and verification of the CerCo C compiler backend, using the (now sadly defunct) [Matita proof assistant](http://matita.cs.unibo.it). 

I have a PhD in theoretical computer science from the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences.htm), Edinburgh.
I studied various topics at the intersection of nominal techniques, unification, and type-theory and lambda-calculi.
My supervisor was Murdoch "Jamie" Gabbay.
