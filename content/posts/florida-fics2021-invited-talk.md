I'd like to thank [Prof. Kevin Butler](https://cise.ufl.edu/~butler) for inviting me to give a keynote talk at the Technical Demo Conference within the [Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research (FICS)](https://fics.institute.ufl.edu) at the University of Florida.
My slides for the talk&mdash;Confidential Computing: Brave New World&mdash; are available [here](../../talks/confidential-computing-brave-new-world-september-2021.pptx) in Microsoft PowerPoint format.
