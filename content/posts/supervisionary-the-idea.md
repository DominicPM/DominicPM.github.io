Nick Spinale and I recently submitted a short talk abstract to the Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC) workshop, co-located with POPL 2022.
The abstract, which was thankfully accepted for presentation, describes some ideas that Nick and I have been discussing for a while.
I'll use this post to flesh the abstract out and explain the design of the prototype Supervisionary proof-checking system which Nick and I have been working on.
