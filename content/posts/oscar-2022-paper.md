I'm delighted to announce that the abstract, "Scalable assurance via verifiable hardware-software contracts", has been accepted for presentation at the Workshop on Open-source Computer Architecture Research (OSCAR 2022), co-located with ISCA.
This was co-written with Yao Hsiao, Gustavo Petri, Nikos Nikoleris, and Caroline Trippel, with Yao presenting this work at the workshop.
