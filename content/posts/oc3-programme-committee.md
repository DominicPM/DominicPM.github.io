I am honoured to have been invited to serve on the [Open Confidential Computing Conference (OC3 2021)](https://www.papercall.io/oc3-2022) programme committee.
Please, consider submitting a talk proposal!
Derek Miller, from the Veracruz project, presented a talk at [last year's OC3 event](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEhAl3D5WVvSKTp9jD6lV67zuFR8lUZVa) which had a great mix of interesting talks and was very well attended.
