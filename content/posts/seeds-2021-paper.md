I am happy to announce a new paper---an invited contribution from industry---accepted at the IEEE International Symposium on Secure and Private Execution Environment Design (SEED 2021): "Seeds of SEED: Confidential Computing---a brave new world".
This was written with some of my colleagues at Arm: Gustavo Petri, Nick Spinale, Gareth Stockwell, and Hugo Vincent.
